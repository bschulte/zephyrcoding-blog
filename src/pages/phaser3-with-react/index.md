Phaser is an awesome game dev library written in Javascript that makes it incredibly easy to implement your ideas into actual game form. React is an awesome library for building user interfaces in web apps. One thing I was wondering is can we use React to implement game UIs for Phaser?

It's all in the browser, so as long as we can figure out the layout and communication between the two it should be possible. What I've gotten working is a _very_ rough example to show how things might work together!
